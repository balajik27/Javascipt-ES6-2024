Store sample numbers in array for eg: [3,56,2,89,29,90,4,21,7,66] like this.

Then print only the numbers which is divisible by 2 or 3

Output: 3,56,2,90,4,21,66

Hint : here 56 is divisible by 2 because when it is divided by 2 then the remainder is 0.

        let array = [3,56,2,89,29,90,4,21,7,66];

        if( array == 'divide') {

            console.log()
