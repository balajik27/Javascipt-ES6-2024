What is JS and why JS in web development?

JS is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language.
It is primarily used for client-side scripting on the web, allowing developers 
to create interactive web pages. JavaScript is also popular for developing desktop
and mobile applications, as well as server-side programming with technologies 
such as Node.js.

JavaScript is often used to add interactive behavior to websites, 
create web applications, and develop desktop and mobile applications.
